# TicTacToe-AI
A demonstration of Artificial Intelligence through the game Tic-Tac-Toe.

## Description:
  The above file contains the logic and the implementation of the algorithm
  **MINIMAX**, according to which, the computer computes every possible move
  of the opponent and tries to make optimal moves by calculating results of
  each move,(Both by the computer and the opponent) through recursion.
