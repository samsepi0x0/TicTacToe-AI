# TicTacToe-AI!!
  Python Code for AI-TicTacToe.
  
## Description:
  The above file contains the logic and the implementation of the algorithm
  **MINIMAX**(part of _Game Theory_), according to which, the computer computes every possible move
  of the opponent and tries to make optimal moves by calculating results of
  each move,(Both by the computer and the opponent) through recursion.
  To know more about the Minimax Algorithm and Game Theory, go [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/game-theory-minimax-f84ee6e4ae6e).

## Requirements:
  The code requires Python3 installed in your local system.
  For installation instructions, refer the [Official](https://www.python.org/downloads/) site.
  For Command-Line installation, use the commands:
  ```bash
  $ sudo apt-get update && apt-get install python3
  ```
  Check your Python version using:
  ```bash
  $ python3 --version
  ```

## Usage:
  Clone the directory using command:
  ```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/samsepi0x0/TicTacToe-AI.git
  ```
  Run the python file using:
  ```bash
  $ cd TicTacToe-AI
  $ python3 board.py
  ```
## How to Play:
  The expected output on running the Python file is:
  ```
            |     | 
        ----+-----+----
            |     |
        ----+-----+----
            |     |
            
  ```
  The numbers between 1 to 9 represent the grid address, in the following way:
   ```
        (1) | (2) | (3) 
        ----+-----+----
        (4) | (5) | (6)
        ----+-----+----
        (7) | (8) | (9)
            
  ```
  Start the game by making a move.
  To make a move, enter the number repersenting the cell address you want to fill.
  As easy as that!
